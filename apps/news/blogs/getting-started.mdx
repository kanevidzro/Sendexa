## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Visit [sendexa.co](https://sendexa.co) and click **"Get Started"**
2. Enter your email address and create a strong password
3. Check your email for a verification link and click it

## Step 2: Verify Your Domain

To ensure maximum email deliverability, you need to verify your domain:

### Add DNS Records

Navigate to **Settings → Domains** and follow these steps:

1. Click **"Add Domain"**
2. Enter your domain name (e.g., `mail.yourcompany.com`)
3. Copy the CNAME records provided
4. Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
5. Add the CNAME records to your DNS settings
6. Return to Sendexa and click **"Verify Domain"**

<Note type="warning" hideIcon={false}>
  DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours. If verification fails, wait a bit and try again.
</Note>

### DNS Records You'll Need

| Record Type | Name | Value |
|------------|------|-------|
| CNAME | sendmail | sendmail.sendexa.co |
| TXT | dkim | v=DKIM1; p=YOUR_DKIM_KEY |

## Step 4: Create Your First Campaign

Now it's time to send your first email:

### Campaign Types

<Tabs defaultValue="newsletter">
  <TabsList>
    <Tab value="newsletter">Newsletter</Tab>
    <Tab value="promotional">Promotional</Tab>
    <Tab value="transactional">Transactional</Tab>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="newsletter">
    Regular emails sent to your subscriber list with updates and news.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="promotional">
    Time-sensitive campaigns designed to drive action (sales, events, etc).
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="transactional">
    Automated emails triggered by user actions (welcome emails, confirmations, etc).
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

### Creating Your Campaign

1. Go to **Campaigns → New Campaign**
2. Select your campaign type
3. Choose your audience (contact list)
4. Design your email using the drag-and-drop editor
5. Set up A/B testing (optional)
6. Schedule or send immediately

<Callout type="success" title="Pro Tip">
  Use personalization tags like `{{firstName}}` to make your emails feel more personal.
</Callout>

## Step 5: Design Your Email

The email editor is intuitive and powerful:

```
Basic Structure:
├── Header (Logo, navigation)
├── Hero Image
├── Main Content
├── Call-to-Action Button
└── Footer (Links, unsubscribe)
```

### Best Practices

- **Keep it mobile-friendly**: 60% of emails are opened on mobile devices
- **Use clear CTAs**: Make your call-to-action button prominent and obvious
- **Test before sending**: Use the preview feature to check across devices
- **Optimize images**: Compress images to reduce file size
- **Keep it concise**: Aim for 150-200 words in the body

<CodeBlock language="html" title="Simple Email Template">
{`<html>
  <body style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    <h1>Welcome to Sendexa</h1>
    <p>Hi {{firstName}},</p>
    <p>Thanks for joining us. We're excited to have you on board.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com/start" 
       style="background: #007bff; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; 
              border-radius: 5px; text-decoration: none;">
      Get Started
    </a>
  </body>
</html>`}
</CodeBlock>

## Step 6: Monitor Your Results

After sending your campaign, track its performance:

### Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Delivery Rate** | % of emails successfully delivered |
| **Open Rate** | % of recipients who opened the email |
| **Click Rate** | % of recipients who clicked a link |
| **Conversion Rate** | % of clicks that led to desired action |
| **Bounce Rate** | % of emails that failed to deliver |
| **Unsubscribe Rate** | % of people who opted out |

## Common Questions

<Callout type="warning" title="Why are my emails going to spam?">
  This can happen due to domain verification issues, poor sender reputation, or flagged content. Check your DKIM/SPF settings and review email content for spam triggers.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Can I schedule campaigns in advance?">
  Yes! When creating a campaign, select "Schedule" instead of "Send Now" to choose when your email should be delivered.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="What's the best time to send emails?">
  Generally, Tuesday-Thursday at 10 AM in your recipient's timezone performs well, but test different times to find what works for your audience.
